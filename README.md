# NetGL - OpenGL Wrapper for .NET Applications

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

NetGL is a user-friendly wrapper that enables the use of OpenGL functions in .NET applications. This project started approximately 9 years ago and has evolved over the years. Due to professional commitments and other circumstances, I couldn't update it as regularly as I would have liked.

Now that I have more time available and, particularly, thanks to my professional experience, I'm better acquainted with the topic. I'm finally determined to bring this project to a successful conclusion.

## Features

- Seamless integration of powerful 3D graphics into .NET applications.
- Easy integration in any .net proejct.

## Beta Version

Please note that NetGL is currently in beta. While it's functional, there may be some features undergoing refinement. Feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated.
